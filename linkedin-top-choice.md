With 9+ years of diverse data science experience and recent recognition as one of the "40 Under 40 Data Scientists," I'm uniquely positioned for this Senior Data Scientist role focusing on generative AI and manufacturing. My experience delivering successful GenAI projects at Shell, including a business operations AI transformation analyzing 1.2M records, directly aligns with the role's focus on innovative AI solutions for manufacturing optimization.
I bring proven expertise in developing scalable ML solutions with measurable impact ($3M cost savings through ML implementations), making me well-equipped to drive the manufacturing optimization and financial forecasting initiatives outlined in the role. My technical stack (PyTorch, TensorFlow, advanced LLM frameworks) and experience leading AI bootcamps demonstrate I can both develop cutting-edge solutions and guide junior data scientists, fulfilling both the technical and leadership aspects of this position.
